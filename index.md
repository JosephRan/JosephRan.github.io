### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 is one of my favorite labs as it was one of my first actual experiences
    with coding. It taught me how to piece together and write code to help solve certain
    problems. It specifically had me write a piece of code that would convert fahrenheit
    to celcius.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 is another favorite lab of mine, as it was the first time I have ever
    wondered how they calculate dates and the difference between the two. It was very interesting
    to see the long formula that went into giving a date a numerical value.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 is my third favorite, as it was amazing to see the colored gif that my
    lab partner and I had created. It was spectacular to see what computers can do. It was also one
    of the few labs in which we used multiple cc files that would pull from eachother to execute the
    code they were given.
